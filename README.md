# Offline M-Pesa PWA

An offline-first Progressive Web App built with React and TypeScript that enables merchants to manage orders and accept M-Pesa payments in low-connectivity environments.

## Key Features
- Offline-first architecture using local persistence
- Reliable background synchronization for orders and payments
- M-Pesa (Daraja) STK Push integration (sandbox)
- Performance-focused design aligned with Core Web Vitals
- Accessible, mobile-first user interface
- Defensive error handling for real-world failures

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Service Workers
- IndexedDB (planned)
- REST APIs
- M-Pesa Daraja API

## Project Status
Initial repository scaffolding and architectural setup
